# Frequency Spectrum Of Words
A tool that displays the frequency spectrum of a pre-recorded word

# Description
The tool can display the frequency spectrum in two ways:<br>
• Frequency spectrum display for a single window, where the spectrum is displayed as a histogram<br>
• Display of the frequency spectrum of the entire signal, where the spectrum is displayed as a sonogram<br><br>
When displaying the frequency spectrum for a single window, the diagram on the horizontal axis has the frequency, and at
the vertical axis has the magnitude. The frequency is shown in Hz and the magnitude scaled to the range 0-100.<br><br>
The second diagram is to show the entire frequency spectrum, with a time axis (sonogram). The horizontal axis shows the time, the vertical frequency, and the intensity of the point at the diagram represents the magnitude.<br>
By pressing Ctrl+s on the diagram you can save it in pdf format.<br><br>
